        <p>
          College life is one of the biggest transitions we go through in our
          lives. It is like stepping into a world of new experiences, learning,
          and the biggest of all, independence. College is a big step for
          college students, and it's a time when they navigate the world of
          academia while also growing in their personal lives. The halls of
          college education are not only filled with academic discourse and
          lectures, but also with a symphony of college life. It is more than
          just a place of higher education; it is a place where a variety of
          experiences come together to shape young people's identities. For many
          students, it is the first time when they navigate the intricate
          balance of academic responsibilities, social engagements, and personal
          development without the familiar environment of home. As they attend
          lectures, study late into the night, and take part in the hustle and
          bustle of campus life, they embark on a journey of intellectual and
          personal growth.

                  To better understand the change from students' perspectives, I
                  asked a bunch of college students how their life changed after
                  they started their college education. I asked them about the
                  challenges they faced, differences they felt, and how they
                  dealt with them. As we explore the stories of our friends, we
                  are trying to know how they've grown, from making lifelong
                  friends to understanding themselves and the world better. In
                  the following slides, there are the transcripts of my
                  discussions with those students:

                  I have definitely noticed a lot more independence and
                  responsibility. Since coming to college, I have been able to
                  make my own schedule and my own decisions about all my
                  academics and my day to day life; and academically there are a
                  lot of different subjects and courses that I can pursue so
                  that that made me curious about what I actually have to do and
                  there are also a lot of different people here, with a lot of
                  different kinds of backgrounds so I am able to view a lot of
                  different experiences and being away from the familiar
                  environment of my home, it allows personal growth and
                  self-discovery so I can learn a lot about myself and what I
                  actually enjoy doing.

                  Right, and what was the biggest difference you felt between

                  The biggest difference between the college and my high school
                  is probably the size. Where I went to high school, my
                  graduating class was very small, it was a little less then
                  forty people. So, the switch from that to a really large
                  school like Texas Tech, it’s just that I can’t know everybody
                  like I did when I was in high school.

                  So, After coming to college, I wouldn’t say, my life has
                  turned upside down or anything. But after coming here, It was
                  a big change because I am an international student over here,
                  so I had a lot of cultural shocks in the first place but
                  leaving home and coming 4000 miles away to pursue higher
                  education is challenging. Stating from various cultures like
                  eating habits to staying in dorms, everything changed the way
                  I used to live back in my home. I think it’s for the greater
                  good in a way preparing me for the future and I don’t see
                  changes as something bad because change is unenviable, and I
                  like to welcome it with open arms.
                </p>
              </div>
              <div class="me">
                <span>Me</span>
                <p>
                  What was the biggest challenge for you as an international
                  student or a college student overall?

                <p>
                  I believe, the worst part about college is juggling a lot of
                  things at the same time so the biggest challenge would be Time
                  management. Because back in my home, things were assisted by
                  my parents and siblings and here I have to do everything on my
                  own. I had to do laundry and studies were there obviously, but
                  I had to do a lot of things that didn’t do. So time management
                  was the most challenging thing for me.

                  Well my life has changed a lot especially because I became
                  more independent and responsible and like it I have become
                  more independent in a way like I wasn't that responsible and
                  independent because I relied more on my parents and like the
                  people around me; and also being the youngest in my family, I
                  was already loved and overly like taken care of. So just like
                  going away from home and all that luxury life I had back home
                  I had to give up all of that and yeah that was like that's
                  like one of the things that has changed a lot.

                  like I've never had to you know worry about my financial
                  status and all that like if I'm spending money on stuff if I'm
                  like you know paying money for food and all that like that was
                  usually taken care of and I had like I had never ever in my
                  life like I had to think about those kind of stuff.

                  Barzillai Newton is a freshman with a majors in Mechanical
                  Engineering. He expresses a significant shift in his life,
                  particularly in terms of increased independence and
                  responsibility. He seems to feel a sense of challenge and
                  adjustment, noting that he had to let go of the financial
                  security and support he previously enjoyed. His mention of
                  having to think about financial matters for the first time
                  suggests a new level of responsibility that may be both
                  daunting and transformative. Overall, there seems to be a mix

                  Definitely the education. I believe that the public education
                  system i.e. high school has a completely failed students and
                  then we come to college it's actually you know really eye
                  opening because you realize the failure of your public
                  education that you've been in for about like 12 years of your
                  life.

                  So after coming to college, I believe that I've been able to
                  meet a lot of new people from different cultural backgrounds
                  and mindsets, so it has been it has helped me in exposing
                  myself to a new circle of people and grab new ideas, exchange
                  new ideas, new cultures, and new traditions from them and
                  share my culture with them and also share their experiences
                  and my experiences. Apart from that, I believe college
                  education college education has been a big difference for me
                  as compared to high school education because the college
                  education has been interactive it has been interactive in a
                  way that it has helped me mold my mind and my perspective into
                  one that has been able to cultivate the knowledge, and it has
                  been exposed to into my daily life so yeah.

                  Since I'm an international student there, so after coming to
                  the US, there have been many big differences for me whether
                  it's been related to food, culture, people, or even the
                  environment. It's been an alien environment for me so for the
                  past three months I'm trying to adjust to the weather, to the
                  food, to the culture, to the traditions, and to the people. I
                  wanna understand the people that live over here and understand
                  their mindset, the things that they believe are important for
                  them and the things that they believe are not important

        serves as a catalyst for intellectual and personal development. The
        shift from the familiar boundaries of high school to the expansive
        landscape of college education teaches adaptation, resilience, and a
        redefinition of self. Challenges such as cultural adjustments, time
        management, and financial independence become motivates for growth,
        fostering a deeper understanding of one's capabilities and passions.
